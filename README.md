IOTDB / Home☆Star Controller - Empty Bridge

<img src="https://github.com/dpjanes/iotdb-homestar/blob/master/docs/HomeStar.png" align="right" />

This Home☆Star module contains a number of Models that can be reused
in other projects. In and of itself, this "Null" Bridge 
does nothing.

For more information about IOTDB / Home☆Star,
see [the project page](https://github.com/dpjanes/iotdb-homestar).

## Models
### Values

All of these models have a single
attribute called <code>value</code>
with varying types. 

These are useful when you're reading
or writing a value from/to a pin
but it has no real semantic meaning.

* ValueBoolean
* ValueColor
* ValueDate
* ValueDatetime
* ValueInteger
* ValueNumber
* ValuePercent
* ValueString
* ValueTime
* ValueUnit
